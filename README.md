# UnrealLiveProject

This project was created in Unreal Engine 4 with assets from the Epic learning center. I completed a number of challeneges in different parts of this level. 

-Story 1: I created platforms to get the player over a pit by updating static meshes and collision details. I also created a pain causing volume box in the pit to restart the level if the player fell down. 

-Story 2: In this portion of the level I created floating islands with a level sequence to make a moving land bridge that the player has to time correctly to get across to the goal. 

-Story 3: I utilized coins to encourage level exploration and updated vaiables with a jump boost object to ensure the player could reach the top of this area to collect all items. 

-Story 4 anbd 5: These stories focused on making a key to open the door to the next part of the level, this included a blueprint to check if the player has the key and then has a begin overlap event that allows the door to unlock once the player gets to the door.

-Story 6: The HUD was updated to include a gem and coin counter and then a popup message to tell the player they have collected all items and can now head towards the end of the level.

-Story 7: Once the player reaches the end of the level and goes through the door, I set up a trigger event to bring up the game completion widget that lists the time it took to complete the level, the gem/coin count and a button to bring the player to the starting point.
